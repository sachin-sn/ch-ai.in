excerpt: "A small Node server in a naive Docker image, then in a multi-stage one, then in a local Kubernetes cluster. Image sizes, a cache test, and a surprise in how many pods answered. I did not finish the whole plan, and this post says what is missing."

Day 16 ran code at the edge, with no region to pick. Day 17 goes the other way:
a container that I build, size and run myself, first with Docker and then in a
local Kubernetes cluster made with `kind`. I took the Day 15 core (a hash route
and an info route), wrapped it in a plain Node HTTP server, and measured what
happened. I did not finish the plan. The slow-stop test, the undo of the bad
update and the clean-up are missing, and I say where below.

## A 1.7 GB image for 2 kB of code

The first image was the simple one: `FROM node:22`, `COPY . .`, `npm install`,
run the TypeScript with `tsx`.

```
                DISK USAGE   CONTENT SIZE
node:22         1.64GB       418MB
day17:naive     1.7GB        421MB
```

My prediction was "the size of Node 22 plus a few KB". The shape was right: my
own layers were `npm install` (50.1 MB) and the app files (49.2 kB). I did not
expect the base image itself to be 1.64 GB. The first prediction about build time
("a few seconds, mostly download") I could not test, because `node:22` was
already on my Mac. The build took 3.2 s with nothing to download.

## Multi-stage: 346 MB

The second Dockerfile has two stages. The first runs `npm ci` and bundles
`server.ts` and the core into one file with esbuild. The second starts from
`node:22-slim` and copies only that file. It runs as the user `node`.

```
                DISK USAGE   CONTENT SIZE
day17:multi     346MB        79.8MB
day17:naive     1.7GB        421MB
```

I predicted it would be bigger than 1.7 GB. It was about five times smaller. The
final `/app` holds one 2154-byte file, where the naive one holds 37 MB of sources
and `node_modules`. I did not measure `node:22-slim` alone, so I cannot say how
much of the 346 MB is just the base.

I checked the image with commands. The process runs as `uid=1000(node)`. With
`--read-only` the server still answered `/hash?input=abc` correctly, and a
`touch` in `/app` and in `/tmp` was refused. I made a fake `.env` file and built
again. `docker history` and a search inside the image found nothing, and a search
for a word that is in the bundle found it, so the search works. My first try
proved nothing, because I made the `.env` after the build.

## The cache test

Three builds. One line added to `server.ts` each time.

```
                        steps cached   steps that ran        total
good order              5              COPY . . , build      1.4 s
broken order            3              COPY . . , npm ci, build   1.8 s
```

My prediction was "4 layers, all of them". Wrong: `COPY . .` has to run again
when a source file changes. In the good order `npm ci` stayed cached. In the
broken order, with `COPY . .` first, `npm ci` ran again for 1.0 s although no
dependency had changed. That is one run of each and the app has few
dependencies, so I cannot tell how large the effect is in a real project.

One more thing: the last step (copy the bundle into the final image) stayed
cached even after the source change. The comment I added does not appear in the
esbuild output, and the final image had the same manifest hash in all builds. I
did not compare the two bundle files directly.

## Three pods, how many `instanceId` values?

I put the image in a kind cluster, with 3 replicas and a Service in front. The
`/info` route returns an `instanceId` that each process makes once. I wrote two
predictions: 30 different values through `kubectl port-forward service/day17`,
and 1 value from a pod inside the cluster.

```
port-forward, 30 calls     1 value
from inside, 30 calls      3 values (4, 14, 12 calls)
```

Both predictions were wrong. With 3 pods, 30 values was never possible. The
`port-forward` calls all went to one pod. The calls from inside went to all
three. My first try inside the cluster counted only 25 of 30 results, and I do
not know why. I ran it again, reading the pod log, and got all 30 (every status
was 200). The split between the pods was uneven, 7/9/9 in the first run and
4/14/12 in the second, and I have no explanation for that. I have not yet read
what the `port-forward` documentation says about Services, so I do not
claim a reason.

## A good update and a bad one

I ran a loop in the cluster that called the Service about every 200 ms and
printed the status code. The Deployment has `maxUnavailable: 0` and
`maxSurge: 1`.

The update from v1 to v2 logged 745 requests and none had a status other than 200. Then I made v3, whose `/healthz` returns 500. The rollout stopped at one
new pod that was `Running` but `0/1` ready, while the three old pods stayed
`1/1 Running`. The loop logged 491 requests and none failed.

That is what I saw. What I did not see: the probe events (my `describe` command
printed none), a restart of the new pod after 60 s (I expected the liveness probe
to cause one), and the undo. So I cannot say from my own output which probe held
the rollout back. `READY 0/1` points to the readiness probe, and that is a
reading, not a check.

## Things that went wrong on the way

My Homebrew is the Intel copy on an Apple Silicon Mac, so `brew install` tried to
compile `kubectl` and failed. I downloaded the programs directly, and my first
`kubectl` download saved an error page because I pasted the word `VERSION` into
the URL. Two of my `docker run` commands failed with "port already in use" (8080 and
8081), because an earlier process or container was still using the port.

## What I'm leaving open

The slow stop (time `kubectl delete pod` before and after a `SIGTERM` handler)
is not done. My only data point is that `docker stop` on the plain Docker
container took 3.2 s. I guessed that a server without a handler would take the
full default wait, and I think that default is 10 s, but I did not check the
docs. The undo of v3 is not recorded, and the clean-up is not done: the cluster
was still running when I stopped. No scanner, no distroless image.

## What's next

Day 18 is observability with OpenTelemetry. Full code in the [repo](https://github.com/sachin-sn/30-day-learning-challenge/blob/main/day-17-docker-multistage-kubernetes) —
